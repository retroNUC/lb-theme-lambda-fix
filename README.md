# lb-theme-lambda-fix

Updated and fixed version of [Lambda](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/2417-lambda-beta/) theme for LaunchBox, which now only seems to be receiving sporiadic updates and missing some of the newer app features.

### ListContentView
- Fixed column sorting for date-related fields, such as 'Release Date' and 'Last Played'
